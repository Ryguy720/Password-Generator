Welcome! 

This is a random password generator! My motivation behind this project was to create random passowords for the user. I did this by creating an Array of options for the application and User to choose from, and created functions in java script to randomise those options into a password. I'm currently getting an error on line 77 of my JS file. this is preventing the passowrd from being generated.
